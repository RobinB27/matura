(Requires an explanation on how the signalLine is calculated and that every individual stock has it's own decision maker)

algorithm MACDDecisionMaking strategy:

    for every iteration:

        makeStockDecision:

            curveComparison = dictionaire past curveComparisons
            update curveComparison

            if value of curveComparison == 1 and value of previous iterations curveComparison == -1:
                buy stock
            if value of curveComparison == -1 and value of previous iterations curveComparison == 1:
                sell stock
            else:
                ignore stock 

update curve comparioson: 

    calculate SignalLineValue and MACDValue

    compare MACDValue and signalLine to yield curveComparison value:

        if SignalLineValue > MACDValue
            curveComparison = 1
        else if  SignalLineValue < MACDValue
            curveComparison = -1
        else:
            curveComparison = 0

        return curveComparison
